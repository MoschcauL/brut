# Brut
## A Minimal Brutalist theme for Hugo

> This is a heavy work in progress for my personal site.

TODO:
+ css for code blocks and block quotes [Issue #1](https://github.com/robjloranger/brut/issues/1)
+ micro data [Issue #2](https://github.com/robjloranger/brut/issues/2)
+ better semantic markup
+ accessibility

This theme is designed for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) version `0.48` or greater.

For live example see my [homepage](https://robloranger.ca).
